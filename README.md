# ONS_series
A method of downloading ONS time-series data using CDIDs 

See the excel for a how-to. 

The code goes to the ONS website - downloads the series included in the list called: relevant_data
* This can include multiple series - however the ONS will throttle if too many are in the list. 

The user is asked to select a time interval whether they wish to download the series or view charts. 
* If the user selects download a csv file will be saved in the directory.
